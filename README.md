# TvRumble
Simple Swift/Spritekit fight game, with TV shows characters.


# NOTES

*This repository lacks the original assets and sound files. There are too many of them and they are not my work.*
*This project was made possible thanks to the work of some wonderful people I had the plaesure to work with during the iOS Foundation base course, at the University of Naples "Parthenope". Most of them didn't contribute to this project with code, so their work and their names don't belong here.*
*Comments and some other stuff within the code are in italian. Sorry.*
